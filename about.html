     <p class="description">
          I'm passionate about technology and love working on software development, system integration, and front-end design.
          With hands-on experience in Python, C++, Flutter, HTML, and CSS, I enjoy creating solutions that are both practical and user-friendly.
          I'm a problem-solver who communicates well and thrives in collaborative environments.
          Now, I’m eager to find a role where I can keep learning, grow my skills, and contribute meaningfully.
